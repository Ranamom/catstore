  Happy Paws Pet Store
</h1>

I love Cats 🐈. We will build a pet store app called `Happy Paws` for our customers to purchase some adorable Cats. Customers can buy cats by adding their details to the cart 🛒 and then finally checkout by completing the payment process 💳.

Here is a quick glimpse of the app we intend to build,

Build Status: [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/82cddbc2-c063-46e9-a7b7-638fd6b6e2f0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/happy-paws/deploys)

> Please note, Stripe is NOT available in all countries. Please check if [Stripe is available in your country](https://stripe.com/global). The Demo setup uses a test Stripe account created from the India region. Hence, it is guaranteed to work when accessed from India, and I hope it works elsewhere. However, that doesn't stop you from following the rest of the tutorial.
